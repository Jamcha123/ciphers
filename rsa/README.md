#RSA 

RSA is the private-public key encryption algorithm.
My program uses pkcs1 and pkcs10 to generate a private and public key 

I am using the nodejs crypto library. 

How to use: 
    
    git clone https://github.com/Jamcha123/crypthub
    cd ciphers
    cd rsa

then: 

    npm install 
    node index.js
